=> for the categories to blur out the imahes we willl use blurRadius:
<I

/>

=> there are many on presses so we can use on long press for example for whatever reason:
onPress, onLongPress..

=> for alerts, login successful or register successful:
import Alert (if you want to change the title f the alert)
onPress={()=> Alert.alert("whatever tittle", "whatever message", [text:"yeaa", text: naah"])} //if we want to put options
//or we can use Alert.prompt if we want an answer

=> for android there are too many screen sizes to insure that safe area is there in styles we put:
const styles = StyleSheet.creatte({
    container:{
        flex....
        paddingTop : Platfor.OS === "android" ? 20: 0   
        //or for more accuracy instead of guesses (recommended) 
        paddingTop : Platform.OS === "android" ? StatusBar.currentHeight
    }
})

=> to resize image to its og size:
<Image resizeMode="contain"
style...
source...
/>
